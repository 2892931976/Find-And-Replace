This is a Python script which does Find and Replace.

In its current form, it will look in every file and every directory for more files for the words in the dictionary and replace them with the corresponding words.

To change what it looks for, simply replace the replaceDic to different strings. For example replaceDic = {"GameScene":"GameLayer"} - It'll search for "GameScene" and replace it with "GameLayer" in every single file of the folder that the script is in.

It can be made to just search for 1 file, simply by switching pathToSearch to the file in question and instead of scanDir(pathToSearch), do checkFiles(patchToSearch). This will make it search just 1 file.

This is a Python script which does Find and Replace.

In its current form, the script will first ask how many phrases are being looked for.

It will loop the number of times you told the phrases are being looked for for the phrase it's looking for and the phrase that will be placed there.

It will then ask which file you want to search through. If no file is entered, it will search through the entire folder and sub-folders for files that have the phrases you are searching for.
